<h2><a name="errors" class="anchor" href="#errors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I report errors</h2>
<p>
If you find issues please <a href="https://github.com/zachanassian/tu_optimize/issues">report them in github</a>. 
Please add information how to reproduce the issue.   
</p>

<h2><a name="gui" class="anchor" href="#gui"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commandline is ugly. 
Isn't there a better user interface</h2>
<p>
Flash Tyrant has a great user interface on top of tyrant_optimize. Just look at this screenshot:
</p>

</p>
<p>
Source is available <a href="https://github.com/WarrantyVoid/tyrant-optimize-gui">here on github</a>. 
It has to be adjusted to read cards.xml in tyrant unleashed format. My estimate is that this would take another 10 to 15
hours and at the moment I am too busy. But perhaps somebody else finds the time to set it up... Would be great!
</p>
<p>In the meantime rbwabd 
<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/forums/338-tyrant-unleashed/topics/392146" target="_blank">created an excel UI</a> 
to work with tu_optimize. This might be another option if you are using excel.

<h2><a name="batch" class="anchor" href="#batch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to define a batch file (windows)</h2>
<p>The information about batch is outdated. Check the inline help. You can now define group of decks in
<code>customdecks.txt</code>. There might still be use cases where creating a batch file is useful. So I will keep
the information at least for now.
</p>
<p>If you sim with the same set of parameters multiple times you should consider creating a batchfile. Windows uses 
.bat-files. Once defined they can be used like a normal command. You can use a normal texteditor to edit a batchfile.
In this example a batch file <code>simbatch1.bat</code> is created with the <code>echo</code> command. 
Next line shows how to use <code>simbatch1.bat</code></p>
<pre>
>echo tu_optimize %1 "eerie-spam;nbd-spam;mydeck" -r sim 1000 > simbatch1.bat
>simbatch1 mydeck

<h2><a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History of tu_optimize</h2>
<p>
I play and played flash tyrant for several years and the original tyrant_optimze was the fastest optimizer 
and highly used by all players. When tyrant unleashed started I had a look at the source code of tyrant_optimize and 
figured it would take something in the ballpark of 20 hours to adjust the sources to work for tyrant unleashed. Unfortunatly 
I was very busy and so the project was put on hold.
</p>
<p>
Few month later I had to learn git for another project so I was looking for a none trivial example to work with git and 
github. tyrant_optimize came to my mind again and so I started with this project. Effort till first version 0.8 
(first alpha) was around 24 hours so my original guess was pretty accurate.     
</p>

<h2><a name="webpage" class="anchor" href="#webpage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>There are a lot of typos on this webpage</h2>
<p>
By now you should or could have figured out, that English is not my first language. So sorry but this is as good as I could. 
However this webpage is also hosted on github. You can find the sources 
<a href="https://github.com/zachanassian/tu_optimize/tree/gh-pages">here</a>. Just create your own fork. Adjust 
all problems you are aware of and send me a pull request. I will incorporate your changes. Thank you! 
</p>

<h2><a name="ahk" class="anchor" href="#ahk"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
What is the purpose of SimpleTUOptimizeStarter.ahk</h2>
<p>
<code>SimpleTUOptimizeStarter.exe</code> is an executable generated from the
autohotkey script file <code>SimpleTUOptimizeStarter.ahk</code>. So if you are reluctant to run an executable file
from somebody you hardly know then you should install 
<a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">autohotkey</a>, check the script file and execute it directly.
</p>
<p>
Due to the low level features of autohotkey compiled autohotkey script files like <code>SimpleTUOptimizeStarter.ahk</code> can
cause false positiv virus warnings in certain virus scanners. This was discussed 
<a href="http://www.kongregate.com//forums/338/topics/390807?page=12#posts-8057829" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Once again if you are reluctant to run an executable file
from somebody you hardly know then you should install 
<a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">autohotkey</a>, check the script file and execute it directly.</p>
<p>General remark: I do my very best to keep tu_optimize free of virus and any other malware. 
However I do not take any liabilities for this program. For details please check the license information 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachanassian/tu_optimize/master/tu_optimize_license.txt" target="_blank">16. 
Limitation of Liability</a>.</p>    

<h2><a name="public" class="anchor" href="#public"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Why is it public</h2>
<p>
You see the small yellow donate button in the top right corner. That means you can buy me a beer if you like this 
program. And if this program prevents you from buying out two event boxes for 600$ because you realize that the
new card will not improve your deck as much as you hoped everybody execpt synapticon will be happy.
</p>
<p>
But honestly I have a decent job, a great family and can buy a beer myself. But I am really short on time to 
develop this further and add <a href="https://github.com/zachanassian/tu_optimize/issues?state=open">new features</a>.
So I hope somebody from the community steps up to adds stuff. That would be
really great. As a github project everything is available to build you own version. You find the basics on the 
<a href="install.html#compile">install page</a>. If you are interested and need
additional information you can send me a 
<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/zachanassian/private_messages?focus=true" target="_blank">pm
on kongregate</a>. You will need some C++ and git know how but when I started this my last experience 
with C++ was 15 years ago and I wanted to learn git and especially github and not C++. You see it is not that difficult. 
Just give it a try.
